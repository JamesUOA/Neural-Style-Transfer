# Neural-Style-Transfer-codelab

My first tensorflow codelab, this is a pretty cool codelab where you apply the style of an image onto another, in my case my style image was from a manga(japanese comic book) called Naruto I then wanted to apply this art style to a photo of Auckland, New Zealand where I currently live. I'm still new to this so please cut me some slack if my description is incorrect. 
With this project we are using the pretrained image classification network called VGG19 and modifying the intermediate layers to suit our use case. My next gaol is to create my own implementation of these concepts. 

You can find the codelab here, would definately reccomend giving it a go if you haven't already:

**Thought this was pretty cool so I'd share it**
